# Verification and Validation examples

<br>

## Self-codes
The authors of several codes have already proposed test cases to verify and validate their codes. Here are a few examples.


V&V TMAP7 <br>

V&V TMAP8 <br>

V&V FESTIM (including Method of Manufactured Solution and Continuous integration) <br>

V&V mHIT (based on V&V TMAP7) <br>

## Cross-checks between codes
Some authors compare results obtained by differents codes for a same case (test case or specific applied case).

TESSIM, MHIMS and HIIPC for a TDS reproduction (in the frame of Eurofusion project)

TMAP, ABAQUS and FESTIM for a diffusion in multimaterial slab <br>
