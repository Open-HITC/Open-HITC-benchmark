# Diffusion in a multimaterial slab

Based on the cross-check case between TMAP7,FESTIM and ABAQUS publisched in https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-4326/abd95f

## Summary
1D case in a W-Cu-CuCrZr material with continuity of the chemical potential and Fickian diffusion flux accross the material interfaces.
The chemical potential conitnuity is assumed to be ensure by the continuity of the concentration-solubility ratio C/S (thermodynamic equilibrium with gas phase).
